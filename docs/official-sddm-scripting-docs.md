## Scripting in SQL Developer Data Modeler

The scripting capabilities within SQL Developer Data Modeler (SDDM) represent a powerful means of reporting on the details of the models defined within SDDM.

The official documentation of the scripting capabilities can be found in the SDDM installation files which have a slightly different location based on which installation of SDDM is being used.

Embedded version: `<INSTALL_DIR>/sqldeveloper/sqldeveloper/extensions/oracle.datamodeler/xmlmetadata/doc`
Stand-alone version: `<INSTALL_DIR>/datamodeler/datamodeler/xmlmetadata/doc`

Within this directory there are 2 files of interest:

 1. *SQLDeveloperDataModelerScripting.docx* contains an overview of scripting in SDDM, but from the perspective of writing transformation scripts, designed to make modifications to your model programmatically.
 2. *index.html* is an HTML document describing in detail the properties of the objects that are accessible using scripting. Again, this document is geared toward the creation of transformation scripts, but can be used to determine what properties are available to be inspected when performing a design validation. It should also be noted that this document is not 100% accurate.
